                    Let’s face it! If we don’t value our bodies then how can we expect to bring changes
                     to an industry such as fashion, one that’s been telling us we’re not good enough
                      for as long as we can remember! Enough already! At Shopgirls, we embrace women of 
                      all shapes, not only in how we carefully choose each and every single garment that 
                      is brought onto our selling floor but in how we communicate body positivity in 
                      everything we do! Not because it’s trendy (PS we’ve been at this for over 10 yrs!)
                       but because we believe that once you change how you see things, the things you see will change!

                        <h3>About Michelle</h3>

                    <p>
                    As a mother of two pre-teen daughters and someone who was never able to ”just buy 
                    off-the-rack”, Michelle’s 20+yrs of experience in the fashion industry was not always a 
                    warm and fuzzy one. So when Shopgirls came to life, her motivation stemmed from never 
                    feeling like there was anything that suited her body, knowing full well that this need 
                    not be the case. Her focus has always and continues to be making women feel great about 
                    themselves. Period.
